1.  Visit the new TYPO3 DashBoard

    In most cases you will find it in the left menu as the most upper menu
    entry. If not, please ask your admin to activate that module for you.

2.  Click the + icon at the lower right

    ..  figure:: /Images/EmptyDashBoard.png
        :alt: Shows an empty dashboard with the add-button at lower right
        :class: with-shadow

        After opening the dashboard you will find the add-button for widgets
        at the lower right.

3.  Switch to section :guilabel:`System Information`

    Please select category "System Information" from the left sidebar. On older
    TYPO3 versions this section was displayed as a tab above the widget
    selector area.

4.  Choose one of the plesk widgets

    ..  figure:: /Images/AddPleskWidgets.png
        :alt: Shows some panels with selectable widgets. Plesk widgets are
        highlighted
        :class: with-shadow

        Here you can choose one of the delivered widgets (marked in red rects)
        on to your dashboard.
