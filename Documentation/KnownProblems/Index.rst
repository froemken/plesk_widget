Known Problems
==============

Plesk lib 1.0.6
===============

I know, there is a plesk lib 1.0.7 available with much more properties. But this library needs at
least PHP 7.3. As TYPO3 10 needs at min. requirement PHP 7.2 these packages would not be compatible
on some systems. That's why I still use version 1.0.6. In some cases I have extended the
PHP objects to get missing information for the widget like IP addresses.

Plesk Obsidian
==============

This extension was tested for Plesk Obsidian. I don't know, if this extension will work on older
plesk versions.
